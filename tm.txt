I have not played it sadly, I have heard of it though, I was very much not aware it had new editions, granted I have a small bubble of games I monitor, I have a hard time with new games, mainly the purchasing part, until I know I like them ðŸ˜… working on that currently with Xbox battle pass, or trying to haha. 

I did enjoy brilliant diamond though, I played pearl/platinum as a kid, well most pokemon until right after black/white, I recently was able to get into a few other games from Pokemon on the switch as well 

I quite enjoy Skyrim, but V myself, I am bad for loving mods and just enjoy relaxing as I walk around
I suppose that Pokemon has been my longest love, but when we took some time apart, animal crossing stepped up as my obsession and comfort, I have bought devices just to play those, as well as bought and keep buying a Xbox for gta v and binding of Isaac,
